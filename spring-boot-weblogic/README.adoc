http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34525967/spring-boot-exception-could-not-open-servletcontext-resource-web-inf-dispatch[Spring Boot exception: Could not open ServletContext resource]

== Setting up the build environment

Clone this repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/DISID/disid-proofs.git

# Check you have the spring-boot-weblogic project

$ cd disid-proofs/spring-boot-weblogic
----

From this point forward we will refer to the _spring-boot-weblogic_ directory as `PROJECT_DIR`.

Finally, import the `PROJECT_DIR` as "External Maven project" in STS 3.7.

== Run Tests

Web integration tests have been developed for testing purposes, take a look to
_src/test/java_.

To execute these tests just run JUnit from the STS or `mvn test` from
your favorite shell.

== Generate the WAR and deploy in Weblogic 12.1.3

Generate the WAR:

[source,bash]
----
$ cd PROJECT_DIR
$ mvn clean compile war:war

# The spring-boot-weblogic-0.1.0.war file should be in target/ dir
----

Then connect to WebLogic Server Administration Console 12c and deploy the WAR:

. Click the Lock & Edit button
. At _Domain Structure_, click on _base_domain/Deployments_ and press _Install_ button.
. Follow the deployment process. Take in account you must upload the WAR file.
. Press _Activate Changes_ button.
. Finally go to _Control_ tab, select the _spring-boot-weblogic_ deployment and press _Start_ button.
